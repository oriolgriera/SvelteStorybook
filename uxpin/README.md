# UXPin example prototype

These files contain the HTML version of a UXPin prototype. It has to be mentioned that the HTML export feature is in early stages of development, and it is not completely compatible with Storybook. This is the main reason why it is not possible to see the different components of the prototype when opening the files.

To see the prototype in Preview mode you can access the following link: https://preview.uxpin.com/8e1524537052013574bab19708dfba7f29caf49c#/pages/143356052.

To develop the prototype, it has been used the Storybook Design System components. The link to the Storybook is https://storybook-design-system.netlify.app. These components have been programmed using React.
